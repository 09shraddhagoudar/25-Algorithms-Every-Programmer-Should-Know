}/*This Java program demonstrates the implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. Here's a short description of the code:

The code defines two nested classes: Edge to represent edges in the graph and Subset to represent subsets used for cycle detection.

In the main method, a sample graph with 4 vertices and a list of edges is created. The edges are sorted in non-decreasing order of their weights.

The kruskals function is called to find the MST. It takes the number of vertices (V) and a list of edges as parameters.

Inside the kruskals function:

Memory is allocated for subsets and results.
Initially, each vertex is treated as a separate subset.
The program iterates through the sorted edges, selecting the smallest edge that doesn't create a cycle in the MST.
If adding an edge to the MST doesn't form a cycle, it's included in the result.
The union function is used to merge subsets.
The process continues until V-1 edges have been added to the MST.
After constructing the MST, the code prints the edges and their weights, as well as the total cost of the MST.

Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the MST of a graph by iteratively selecting edges with the smallest weight while avoiding cycles. This code efficiently demonstrates the algorithm's core concepts and implementation in Java.*/
